about=This plugin is a tool for radio spectrum management and interference analysis. It allows users to visualize and analyze frequency assignments geographically, identifying potential overlaps between station frequencies. By utilizing station location data and their respective frequency ranges (start and stop frequencies), the plugin detects frequency overlaps between stations, as well as available frequencies that can be assigned.
